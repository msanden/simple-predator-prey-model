# =====================================================================
# The fish are the prey. They move, breed and die.  A fish can breed only
# once it's been in an alive state twelve times.
# To breed it will randomly pick an adjacent location, and if the location
# is empty, a new fish will appear.
# If the location is occupied, the fish will wait until the next time
# it's randomly picked to try to breed again.
